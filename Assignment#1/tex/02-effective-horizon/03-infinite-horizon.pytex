\item \points{2c}

Now consider the infinite-horizon discounted setting. That is, there is no time limit -- the problem can only terminate when a terminal state is reached. Suppose $\gamma = 0$. What action does the optimal policy take when $s = 3$? What action does the optimal policy take when $s = 9$?
